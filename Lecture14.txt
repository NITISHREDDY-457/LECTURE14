Arrays--------->>

An array is a defined collection of similar type of elements which has contiguous memory location.

->Java array is an object which contains elements of a similar data type.
 
->It is a data structure where we store similar elements. We can store only a fixed set of elements in a Java array.

->Array in Java is index-based, the first element of the array is stored at the 0th index, 2nd element is stored on 1st index and so on.


In Java, array is an object of a dynamically generated class. Java array inherits the Object class, and implements the Serializable as well as Cloneable interfaces. We can store primitive values or objects in an array in Java.

Moreover, Java provides the feature of anonymous arrays which is not available in C/C++.
